    "FindingName": "Exchange Mobile Device Mailbox Security Policies",
    "Description": "Enabling and enforcing Exchange Mobile Device Mailbox Policies allows the organization to enforce basic device security requirements when devices are not enrolled in a Mobile Device Management platform, or the tenant is not licensed for Microsoft Endpoint Manager (formerly Intune).",
    "Remediation": "Review any existing policies returned in this finding and ensure they meet organizational requirements. Create or modify policies as required to enforce the organization's desired mobile device security state. If the tenant is licensed for Microsoft Endpoint Management (Intune), Soteria strongly recommends configuring MDM or MAM policies instead as these solutions allow for greater controls over device security and may be used in conjunction with Conditional Access Policies.",
